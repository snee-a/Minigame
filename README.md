Simon Says Game: https://simmonsayss.netlify.app/
I developed this game when i was learning Javascript . This game is totally addictive. This game is based on colours and player's memory.
We will provide you with pattern of colours that you should remember . 

Suppose we gave you Red Blink then you will click on Red. 
then we gave you yellow so you will click on Red ->Yellow.
then we gave you Red again so you will click on Red -> Yellow -> Red.
then we gave you Green so Red-> Yellow->Red ->Green .

So on this will continue and you can check your memory.
